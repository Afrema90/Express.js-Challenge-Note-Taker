This week's challenge we where asked to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The application will use an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Note that the application's front-end has already been created on the Starter Code Repository, so make sure to clone the starter code repository and make my own repository with the starter code. The primary task is to build the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
I worked on this project with my tutor chris B, my study group David, and my proffersor kris R took a while to do it but i belive its done
